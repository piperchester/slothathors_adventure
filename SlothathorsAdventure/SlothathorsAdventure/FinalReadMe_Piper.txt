2.29.12

Directions to play:

1. Press Enter to pass title screen
2. Press B to begin game
3. Use arrow keys to move sloth around screen attacking enemies and picking up loot
	A. Leaves and Flowers increase health
	B. The Rocks increase attack
4. Press C to attack enemies (must be holding C while making contact with enemy to cause damage)
5. Press D to defend against enemies (will not lose health when touching enemy if D is being pressed)
6. Press H to bring up the info screen
7. If you get hit by a net, you instantly lose the game! *Be careful, these are tough to dodge!*
8. Press ESC to exit the program
9. Press X to serialize sloth/room
10. Press L to load serialized sloth/room
11. Press R to read in XML files
12. When you press Enter at the beginning of the game constants are written out to external XML files

New Requirements:

*Could not think of thoughtful place for event or exception*
1. Use Push (SpawnNet.cs, ln 40)
2. Intuitive and easy to use interface / own menu : (Help/Menu Screen, can be accessed with H key) 
	Menu Class that has a background and information, write out information to screen using SpriteBatch.Draw (Menu.cs, MenuText.cs)
	Print out stats of Sloth onto the screen during game time (MenuText.cs ln 80)
3. Must have world, items, and characters to interact with (Flower.cs,Leaf.cs,Rock.cs, Room.cs, Jaguar.cs)

Bonus:

1. Used XNA
2. Have sound in game

Extra work:

1. Backgrounds and sprites were created and edited in Photoshop, all information about sloth is factually
	accurate (aside from the claw sharpening rock), different sounds play for the net, rock, leaf, and jaguar
	Put in a lot of work learning XNA! But glad I did.
